Provider's class are built around the [Capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara)/[Poltergeist](https://github.com/jonleighton/poltergeist) DSL + helper methods.

```ruby
module Heybill
  module Providers
    class Acme < Heybill::Provider
      ask :email
      ask :password

      log_in do
        # Do stuff to log in using Capybara dsl
        # @email and @password available from the 'ask' mehtods above
      end

      fetch_bills do
        # Find every html or PDF invoices included between self.from and self.to
        # Save each invoice with one of those two helpers:

        # If invoice an html document:
        visit('http://acme.com/invoices/1')
        save_page_as_bill(date)

        # If invoice a PDF:
